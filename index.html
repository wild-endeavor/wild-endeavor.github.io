          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
          Hi and welcome!  My short story is this: from a small island off the coast in Seattle to a little town in New York called Ithaca.  From there, I spent seven years on a mortgage desk in the big city and then one day I just left...
          </p>
          <p>
          ...where am I now?  Currently in San Francisco, having taken a fairly intense development bootcamp class at <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum">App Academy</a>, and actively looking for a relatively junior development position.
          </p>
          <p>
          ...and in five years?  Most of the world will be under my control by that time so I'll have a lot to manage. But don't worry, I'll be one of those benevolent dictators.  And I'll still be programming by night - building websites, integrating cool algorithms on the back-end, and hopefully doing so with my friends.
          </p>

            <a href="http://www.bookswithfriends.co"><h4 class="personal link">Books With Friends</h4></a>
            This is my final project for App Academy.  It is meant as an inventory management tool for those with lots of friends who want to borrow books from them, or who borrow a lot of books from others.  It relies heavily on the Google Books API and the associated search suggestion engine.  This is actually a personal interest of mine, since it offers functionality that goodreads.com currently doesn't, so I will be continuing this once I have some free time again.

            This is a light-weight clone of Trello. It uses jQueryUI to allow drag and drop of cards.  Still a work in progress.
