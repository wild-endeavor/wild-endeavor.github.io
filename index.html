          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
          Hi and welcome!  I am a developer with a background in finance and electrical engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
          Before I moved out of New York this past March, I spent seven years on a mortgage trading desk doing research.  It was fun, challenging, and interesting.  Ultimately, over the protests of my former team and my closer friends, I wanted to leave to build things, to create and to innovate - in short, to do software development.  Now in San Francisco, having finished development bootcamp class at <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/#p-curriculum">App Academy</a>, I'm actively looking for a junior software engineering position.
          </p>
          <p>
          What's next?  Hopefully something fast-paced, some place where I'm given the chance to prove myself with lots of elegant, production level code, shipping as often as new features are built.  Over the years, I hope to gain a deep intuition for software, its design and architecture, to be able to play with code as a writer might play with words or a composer toy with notes to create that perfect counterpoint.
          </p>

          <div class="project">
            <a href="http://www.bookswithfriends.co"><h4 class="personal link">Books With Friends</h4></a>
             This is a personal interest of mine and offers functionality that goodreads.com currently doesn't.  Over the years, as I borrowed and lent books to many friends, I lost track of which books were where and when I wanted them back and what I had personally borrowed, and from whom.  I put this site together as an inventory management tool for those who do a lot of book sharing among friends.  It relies heavily on the Google Books API and the associated search suggestion engine, and is built with Rails and Backbone.js.  It's still a work in progress and there's a lot to be done.  I will be continuing this once I have some free time again.

            This is a light-weight clone of Trello. It uses jQueryUI to allow drag and drop of cards.  Still a work in progress.
